memory leaks. using postgres.h(palloc) for internal functions
working on different kind of data. e.g. 



-l 

debug via connecting to pid


when merging until n remaining ranges we need to compare the distance between 2 ranges
ex:
a =[0,10) b =[4,20)
distance(a, b) = -19
distance(b, a) = -5

but what direction are we comparing?
